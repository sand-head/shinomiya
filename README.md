# Shinomiya
An open source Funimation app for iOS and Android, build using Expo and React Native.

## Why?
At the beginning of the Spring 2020 anime season, I came to the realization that in order to watch most of the good shows *legally*, I'd have to chalk up money for a service that has nasty apps with bad app feel.

In a bout of rage, I decided no! If I was gonna have to use Funimation, they're gonna have to make a solid user experience on iOS first. However, then the first episode of *Kaguya-sama* season 2 released exclusively on Funimation, and I decided to forego the one way standoff and just kinda make the Funimation app I wanted to see in the world.

## What's in this repo, anyway?
Great question! Let's run through it together:
1. `shinomiya`, of course, is the Funimation app in question here.
2. `interstella` is a neat little moldable proxy API that keeps track of each unique route visited and the query parameters it takes before returning the requested information.
(It was mostly an excuse for me to try out Deno ;))
