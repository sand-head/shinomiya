# Shinomiya
An open source Funimation app for iOS and Android, build using Expo and React Native.

## Why?
At the beginning of the Spring 2020 anime season, I came to the realization that in order to watch most of the good shows *legally*, I'd have to chalk up money for a service that has nasty apps with bad app feel.

In a bout of rage, I decided no! If I was gonna have to use Funimation, they're gonna have to make a solid user experience on iOS first. However, then the first episode of *Kaguya-sama* season 2 released exclusively on Funimation, and I decided to forego the one way standoff and just kinda make the Funimation app I wanted to see in the world.
